This is a fork of the original colorsqueme inkpot.vim, created by Ciaran McCreesh. You can visit the original homepage here: http://github.com/ciaranm/inkpot

A darkish scheme which works in the GUI and in some 88 colour terminals (urxvt, for example) and 256 colour terminals (xterm with TERM=xterm-256 seems to work). This won't work in regular 8/16 colour terms, and depending upon your setup you may need to sacrifice a few goats to get the 88/256 things to work.

I am using this colorsqueme in a transparent urxvt, so I have removed the background color for the terminal, and changed some colors to make them darker.

Keeping things up to date on vim.org is a nuisance. For the latest version, visit:
